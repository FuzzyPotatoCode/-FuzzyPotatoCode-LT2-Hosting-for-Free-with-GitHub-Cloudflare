        <hr> 
        <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and
            super-efficient heat pump and you're still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green
            work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe
            that power bill for now and into the future.</p>

            <p>Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can guarantee reliable cost-free power to
                your
                home or business. ROI is now taking less time than ever thanks to the ever decreasing equipment costs
                and
                better technology.</p>
            <p>If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium Ion chemistry solutions then you
                can
                take your savings even further.</p>

            <img src="./images/geo250.jpg" alt="Geothermal">
            <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than the air and we can use
                this
                to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you free plentiful
                home
                warming energy year-round.</p>
            <p>Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but has previously been
                geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have
                dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as
                home heating.</p>
            <p>Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are
                much
                lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help
                mitigate global warming if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>

            <img src="./images/turbine250.jpg" alt="Wind Turbines">
            <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a wind turbine system that
                generates
                electricity when the wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your energy
                generation potential.</p>
            <p>New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine works, the benefits of wind energy
                and
                how a wind turbine is installed.</p>
            <p>If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us, contact one of our wind power
                experts for the right advice.</p>
